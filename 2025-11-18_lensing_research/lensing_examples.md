# Examples of Gravitational Lensing

This document contains a summary of famous examples of gravitational lensing, gathered from a web search. This information can be used as a reference for interpreting our own candidate images.

## What is Gravitational Lensing?

Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. It occurs when a massive object (like a galaxy or galaxy cluster) bends the light from a more distant object as it travels toward the observer. This "lens" can magnify, distort, or even create multiple images of the background source.

The key visual signatures to look for are:
- **Arcs:** The light from a background galaxy can be stretched and bent into luminous arcs.
- **Rings (Einstein Rings):** When the observer, lens, and source are perfectly aligned, the light can be smeared into a complete ring.
- **Multiple Images (Einstein Crosses):** A single object, like a quasar, can appear as multiple distinct points of light surrounding the lensing object.

## Famous Examples and Sources

Here are some well-documented examples of gravitational lensing that you can use for comparison.
