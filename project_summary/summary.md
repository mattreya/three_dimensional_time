# Project Summary: Investigation into Anomalous Galaxies

This document summarizes the investigation into anomalous galaxy candidates, driven by the hypothesis that they may be evidence of orthogonal dimensions.

## 1. Initial Analysis and Candidate Selection

- **Objective:** The project began with the goal of identifying and analyzing anomalous galaxies from the Euclid dataset. The initial hypothesis was that some galaxies might exhibit properties (like accelerated maturation, implied by redshift) that contradict established astrophysical models.
- **Data Mining:** An initial analysis was performed on `2025-09-17` to mine the Euclid data for candidates with extreme `ellipticity` values.
- **Extreme Candidates Identified:** This analysis yielded two primary candidates for further investigation, representing the extremes of the ellipticity distribution:
    1.  **High Ellipticity ("Needle"):** An object in the constellation **Horologium**.
        - Coordinates: RA=58.37, Dec=-47.79
    2.  **Low Ellipticity ("Circle"):** An object in the constellation **Draco**.
        - Coordinates: RA=275.14, Dec=64.97

## 2. Hypothesis: Orthogonal Galaxies and Dimensional Lensing

The core hypothesis of this project is that these extreme shapes are not merely a result of viewing angle, but are potential evidence of "orthogonal galaxies" existing in a different temporal dimension.

This led to a second, more specific hypothesis:

- **Dimensional Lensing:** It was proposed that massive, unobservable objects (such as dark matter halos) could be acting as "lenses." Instead of just bending light in our own spacetime (gravitational lensing), these objects might be "folding" spacetime in such a way that they create a "prism" or "window" into an orthogonal dimension, making these otherwise invisible galaxies observable to us.

## 3. Search for Evidence of Dimensional Lensing

- **Action Taken:** To test the "dimensional lensing" hypothesis, we downloaded images of the sky surrounding our two primary candidates. The goal is to visually inspect these fields for classic signs of gravitational lensing (e.g., arcs, rings, or distorted background galaxies), which would indicate the presence of a massive lensing object.
- **Generated Images:** The images have been downloaded and are available for inspection at the following locations:
    - `three_dimensional_time/2025-09-17/lensing_search/Horologium_candidate.png`
    - `three_dimensional_time/2025-09-17/lensing_search/Draco_candidate.png`

## 4. Next Steps

The next step is to visually inspect the two generated images to determine if there is any evidence of gravitational lensing that would support the dimensional lensing hypothesis.
