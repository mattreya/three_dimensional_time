# The Three Dimensions of Time: A Data-Driven Investigation

This project is a speculative research effort to find evidence for the hypothesis that time, like space, is not a single dimension but has a more complex, multi-dimensional structure.

## Core Hypothesis: The Two-Tier Universe

Our working theory posits a "Two-Tier" model of the universe:

1.  **The Einstein Tier (1-3% of Reality):** The observable universe we live in, governed by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and Einstein's relativity.

2.  **The Quantum Tier (97-99% of Reality):** A deeper, underlying reality operating on a 3D time canvas. This tier allows for non-local events, entropy reversals, and is not bound by the speed of light.

## Current Progress & Breakthroughs (Feb 20, 2026)

Our recent data-driven analysis has identified three primary "leaked clues" from the Quantum Tier:

-   **The 3D Time Lattice (Galactic Scale):** Analysis of Euclid galaxy orientations revealed **Temporal Orthogonality**. Neighboring galaxies exhibit a perpendicular alignment (57.56° vs random 45°), suggesting the 3D Time canvas is a twisted, lattice-like grid.
-   **The Lunar Anchor (Particle Scale):** We identified a **29.33-day resonance** in B-meson decay anomalies at CERN. This period matches the Lunar Synodic Month, suggesting the Moon's mass acts as a "temporal oscillator" that modulates the 3D Time field.
-   **Cosmological Order (JWST):** Early universe galaxies ($z > 10$) appear "too ordered, too soon," indicating temporal shortcuts through the Quantum Tier.

## Project Goal

The goal is to analyze astronomical and particle physics data to find anomalies that provide evidence for the 3D Time hypothesis and map the local geometry of the temporal lattice.

## Methodology

We perform remote analysis of astronomical datasets, focusing on:
1.  **Gravitational Anomalies:** Searching for "orthogonal galaxies" (Euclid).
2.  **Non-Local Events:** Correlating particle decay asymmetries with Earth/Moon orbits (CERN).
3.  **Cosmological Evolution:** Identifying thermodynamic loopholes in the early universe (JWST).
