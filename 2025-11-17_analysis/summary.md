# Summary for 2025-11-17

Analysis of Euclid lensing candidates was performed.

The following outputs were generated and placed in the `euclid_plots` directory:

- `ellipticity_distribution.png`: Plot of the ellipticity distribution.
- `high_ellipticity_candidates.csv`: Table of candidates with high ellipticity.
- `low_ellipticity_candidates.csv`: Table of candidates with low ellipticity.
- `point_like_prob_distribution.png`: Plot of the point-like source probability distribution.
- `spatial_distribution.png`: Plot of the spatial distribution of candidates.
